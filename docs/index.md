# Welcome!
If you are just getting acquainted with this repo I'd highly recommend spending a little time reading up on the following tools:
* [Nx](https://nx.dev/)
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
  * [Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/)

Some other tools we are relying on:
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
* [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)
* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)

## VSCode
There will be additional tooling added to support vscode, so I recommend using that so we can all have consistent dev environments.
* Feel free to make changes to the files in the .vscode folder, for extension recommendations, settings, debug scripts, etc.
